		<p>Reviews are an important part in the tutor selection process. Tutor reviews allow students to get a better view on how other students rated their time with their tutor. Reviews can be given for a tutor only after a session has been completed, this allows us to authenticate all of our reviews and guarantee their legitimacy.</p>
	
		<p>If as a student you are unsure if a tutor will be a good fit for you, make sure to check out their reviews to get a better understanding of what previous students have to say.</p>
