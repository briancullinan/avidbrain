      Under California Civil Code section 1786.22, you are entitled to find out what
      is in the CRA’s file on you with proper identification, as follows:

          <ul style="margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">
            <li>In person, by visual inspection of your file during normal business hours and on reasonable notice.
            You also may request a copy of the information in person.  The CRA may not charge you more than the
            actual copying costs for providing you with a copy of your file.</li>
            <li>A summary of all information contained in the CRA file on you that is required to be provided by
            the California Civil Code will be provided to you via telephone, if you have made a written request,
            with proper identification, for telephone disclosure, and the toll charge, if any, for the telephone
            call is prepaid by or charged directly to you.</li>
            <li>By requesting a copy be sent to a specified addressee by certified mail.  CRAs complying with requests
            for certified mailings shall not be liable for disclosures to third parties caused by mishandling of mail
            after such mailings leave the CRAs.</li>
          </ul>
          “Proper Identification” includes documents such as a valid driver’s
          license, social security account number, military identification card, and credit cards.  Only if you
          cannot identify yourself with such information may the CRA require additional information concerning your
          employment and personal or family history in order to verify your identity. The CRA will provide trained
          personnel to explain any information furnished to you and will provide a written explanation of any coded
          information contained in files maintained on you.  This written explanation will be provided whenever a
          file is provided to you for visual inspection.  You may be accompanied by one other person of your choosing,
          who must furnish reasonable identification.  An CRA may require you to furnish a written statement granting
          permission to the CRA to discuss your file in such person’s presence.
