<h3>Language Tutors</h3>
<p>
A <b>Language</b>
consists of a complex system that humans use in order to communicate with one another. In most cases, language is able to be expressed in both written manuscript and spoken dialogue. Some languages can also be expressed through other means, such as hand signals in sign language and tactile stimulation in Braille. Currently, more than 5,000 languages exist worldwide
</p>
<p>
Most individuals are able to effectively communicate in one language. However, many people strive to learn and master additional languages in order to communicate and connect with people of different cultures. Many people make entire careers out of interpreting messages from one language to another. Meanwhile, some people simply find pleasure in discovering new languages and the secrets that they hold. By learning a new language, a person can travel deeper, communicate more effectively and leave lasting impressions upon others.
