		A Community Built on Sharing
	</div>

	<div class="description">
		MindSpree started as an idea in 2013 when Keith Rezendes and David Glaeseman noticed that the current state of the tutoring industry was not fulfilling the needs of many. As a veteran in the tutoring industry Co-Founder Keith Rezendes could clearly see how he could design a place where students could receive the highest quality tutors for the best value. MindSpree is this type of place! By utilizing the sharing economy, MindSpree can utilize tutors across the United States to share their knowledge and expertise with students who are eager to learn.

		Profiles
	</div>

	<div class="description">
		What makes MindSpree unique is that no two tutors are alike. Their pricing, experience, availability and preferred method of tutoring is exclusive to each tutor. Thus, MindSpree makes it easy for each tutor to list their profiles and tell potential students and parents what’s distinctive about them and their services and why they make a good tutor.

		Tutors & Students Collaboration

		MindSpree helps its community stay connected. We encourage tutors to collaborate with other tutors. For example, some of our tutors have partnered to create MCAT, SAT and other prep materials that they can share. At the same time, students can collaborate with each other to share information such as teacher’s recommendation, tutors, classes and school information.

					Multiple Revenue Streams
				</div>
				<p>
					MindSpree is unique in the tutoring industry since we offer multiple revenue streams for our tutors. A tutor does not have to rely on one means to earn money. For example, if you love tutoring but just can’t see yourself in front of a student 8 hours per day, but still want other ways to earn money doing what you love—then MindSpree is for you.
				</p>

				<div class="title sub-title">
					Open to Feedback & Suggestions
				</div>
				<p>
					MindSpree is an open private company. We encourage all our tutors and students to give us feedback and we are open to all suggestions on how we can make our system better. We love all ideas, even on how much to pay our tutors. We have weekly staff meetings and many tutors drop by to listen in as well as give their direct feedback on certain features and services.
				</p>

				<div class="title sub-title">
					Real-life Person to Contact
				</div>
				<p>
					Many tutors, who apply to our company, tell us we are the first online marketplace that actually has a person contact them. Many tutoring firms do not reach out to their tutors. We love the personal interactions since that’s how great relationships are built. We value our tutors as much as our students. To us, being open and communicating with our tutors is a great bonding experience. We interview all our tutors so they know from day 1 that there is a person that they can reach out to with any questions or concerns.

					Your safety is our number one concern. We ensure that all tutors are interviewed and background checked. At the same time we ensure that all students have payments on files.

We can only promise we will continue to work to improve and get better at what we set out to achieve, and that is to be the best tutoring site.
