		The beauty of our system is we give back to schools and organizations for working with us. Any student who you recommend to use our system, after they have a successful session, MindSpree makes a financial donation to their organization. Through this process, MindSpree helps organizations not only fulfill a need, but all gather funding for other programs.

					Your safety is our number one concern. We ensure that all tutors are interviewed and background checked. At the same time we ensure that all students have payments on files. We also monitor our site for malicious and illegal. We also realize that no matter how good our front-line defense is there will be spammers and scammers who slip through the crack and that is an inherent issue with being an open community. We can only promise we will continue to work to improve and get better at what we set out to achieve, and that is to be the best tutoring site.
