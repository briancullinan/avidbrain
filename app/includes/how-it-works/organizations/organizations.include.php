					Since the creation of MindSpree, we have received over 9000 applicants. Due to this large stream of inflow, MindSpree has been able to create a marketplace that can meet the needs of all organizations by providing the best tutors at the cheapest price.

					Raise Money for Your Organization				</div>

								<div class="description">
					The beauty of our system is we give back to schools and organizations for working with us. Any student who you recommend to use our system, after they have a successful session, MindSpree makes a financial donation to their organization. Through this process, MindSpree helps organizations not only fulfill a need, but all gather funding for other programs.				</div>
