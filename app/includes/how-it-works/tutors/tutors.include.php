						<h3>Before your session</h3>
								<p>Before any session, we encourage students and tutors to communicate as to location, place, time and what is expected of each user. It is recommended for tutors to prepare their lesson plan prior to the tutoring session.</p>

								<h3>After your session</h3>
								<p>After each session, we recommend tutors encourage their students to write a summary of how they think their tutor did during that session. This is a testimonial that would help tutors improve their teaching style as well as make it useful for other students who will decide if they should use this tutor in the future. We believe in open communication and our built-in reviews and testimonials will definitely help both tutors and students.</p>

								<h3>Payment &amp; Confirmation</h3>
								<p>MindSpree handles all the payment processing as well as make sure prior to all payment processing that all students have credit card on file prior to the session. Through this process MindSpree can assure all tutors that they will be paid. MindSpree also allows tutors to receive cancellation fees if the student does not show up.</p>
