					Before your session 
				</div>
				<p>
					Before any session, we encourage students and tutors to communicate as to location, place, time and what is expected of each user. It is recommended for tutors to prepare their lesson plan prior to the tutoring session. 
				</p>
				
				<div class="title sub-title">
					After your session
				</div>
				<p>
					After each session, we recommend tutors encourage their students to write a summary of how they think their tutor did during that session. This is a testimonial that would help tutors improve their teaching style as well as make it useful for other students who will decide if they should use this tutor in the future. We believe in open communication and our built-in reviews and testimonials will definitely help both tutors and students.
				</p>
				
				<div class="title sub-title">
					Payment & Confirmation
				</div>
				<p>
					MindSpree handles all the payment processing as well as make sure prior to all payment processing that all students have credit card on file prior to the session. Through this process MindSpree can assure all tutors that they will be paid. MindSpree also allows tutors to receive cancellation fees if the student does not show up.

				<p>
					Your safety is our number one concern. We ensure that all tutors are interviewed and background checked. At the same time we ensure that all students have payments on files. We also monitor our site for malicious and illegal. We also realize that no matter how good our front-line defense is there will be spammers and scammers who slip through the crack and that is an inherent issue with being an open community. We can only promise we will continue to work to improve and get better at what we set out to achieve, and that is to be the best tutoring site.
