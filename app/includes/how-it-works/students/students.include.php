					Automatic Notifications 
				</div>
				<p>
					If there’s a way to automate any process, we are working hard to make it so. This helps all our tutors and students stay connected without the hassles of having to visit our site or constantly messaging their tutors to confirm sessions date, time and location.

				<p>
					Even during a tutoring session, we encourage students to keep a note of what’s covered, how their tutor is doing and to give feedback to their tutor during the session.

				<div class="title sub-title">
					After your session
				</div>
				<p>
					After each session, students are encouraged to write a summary of how they think their tutor did during that session. This is a testimonial that would help tutors improve their teaching style as well as make it useful for other students who will decide if they should use this tutor in the future. We believe in open communication and our built-in reviews and testimonials will definitely help both tutors and students.
