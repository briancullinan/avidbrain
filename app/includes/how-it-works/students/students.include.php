		MindSpree makes it easy to search for a tutor. Students can post a job, such as, “I need help in high-school algebra.” Students can search for a tutor by using our search feature or if they have more specific requirements, check out our advanced search features. After searching and sorting based on price, location, or reviews, students can connect and communicate directly with the tutor of their choice. Lastly, if students can’t find what they are looking for they are always encouraged to contact our support staff to put in a special search request and we would be happy to find a tutor that matches their needs.

					Automatic Notifications
				</div>
				<p>
					If there’s a way to automate any process, we are working hard to make it so. This helps all our tutors and students stay connected without the hassles of having to visit our site or constantly messaging their tutors to confirm sessions date, time and location. Students have the option of setting their notification for tutoring session on their profile setting.
				</p>

				<div class="title sub-title">
					Before your session
				</div>
				<p>
					Before any session, we encourage students and tutors to communicate as to location, place, time and what is expected of each user. For students, if they are expected to bring certain learning materials. Both sides are encouraged to come prepared to have a great tutoring session. If MindSpree can assist in any way to make the preparation easier, we’re here to help.
				</p>

				<div class="title sub-title">
					During your session
				</div>
				<p>
					Even during a tutoring session, we encourage students to keep a note of what’s covered, how their tutor is doing and to give feedback to their tutor during the session. The goal is to have our students have a great tutoring experience so we encourage students to speak up during the session if their tutor is speaking too fast, too slow or going over irrelevant materials that do not pertain to what they need to cover.
				</p>

				<div class="title sub-title">
					After your session
				</div>
				<p>
					After each session, students are encouraged to write a summary of how they think their tutor did during that session. This is a testimonial that would help tutors improve their teaching style as well as make it useful for other students who will decide if they should use this tutor in the future. We believe in open communication and our built-in reviews and testimonials will definitely help both tutors and students.
				</p>

				<div class="title sub-title">
					Payment & Confirmation
				</div>
				<p>
					MindSpree handles all the payment processing for all tutoring sessions. If there’s a discrepancy in the billing or fees, we encourage students to first connect with their tutors to get is resolved and if this is not possible to contact our support staff. We want to ensure proper and correct handling of all charges and payments for both tutors and students. Our goal is to have a great tutoring experience so tutors and students will continue to use our services.

					Your safety is our number one concern. We ensure that all tutors are interviewed and background checked. At the same time we ensure that all students have payments on files. We also monitor our site for malicious and illegal. We also realize that no matter how good our front-line defense is there will be spammers and scammers who slip through the crack and that is an inherent issue with being an open community. We can only promise we will continue to work to improve and get better at what we set out to achieve, and that is to be the best tutoring site.
