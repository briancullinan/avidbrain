I am graduating from the University of Southern California with a double major in Biology and Gerontology, and I plan to attend Stanford Medical School for my MD training starting Fall 2016. Throughout my extensive years of schooling, I found ways to succeed in difficult subjects and standardized tests, not only learning but mastering a broad spectrum of subjects. My key academic achievements are as follows:\r\n\r\n-9 AP subjects (Score of 5 in all subjects)\r\n-2360 SAT (800 Reading, 800 Writing, 760 Math)\r\n-3.98 overall GPA at USC\r\n-38 MCAT (14 Physical Sciences, 12 Verbal, 12 Life Sciences)\r\n-Acceptance to Stanford Medical School\r\n\r\nI don’t consider myself a genius or extremely brilliant; I came to where I am today through persistent effort and a drive to learn, which I hope to instill in my students. I believe that I am an effective tutor because I can breakdown difficult concepts into basic elements that are easier to digest, in ways that my students can relate to.

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

We heard positive feedback from the student about tutoring with you. \r\n\r\nIt looks like you have not yet submitted your session, so I wanted to also offer any assistance you may need in order to submit your sessions through AvidBrain&#39;s online system so that you can get paid. Here is our FAQ guide to the process: \r\n\r\n1.	Login to your tutor account.\r\n2.	Click on the white and green Sessions icon (to the right of the Mail icon along the top navigation bar). There are two ways to setup a session: you can setup a session for a future date and time, or log a session that you have just completed. \r\n3.	To setup a future session or log an already completed session, choose “setup sessions” from the menu on the left-hand column. \r\n4.	Choose one of your students from the dropdown menu. The only students that will appear in the dropdown menu are those students that have responded to an email you have sent. \r\n5.	Once you have selected the student, under &#34;Have you completed this tutoring session?&#34; leave it set to “No” if you are setting up a future session. (This option appears by default). Click on “Yes” if you are logging a past session. \r\n6.	Fill in the Subject, the Hourly Rate you are charging for this student, the year/month/and date of the session, and the time and length of the session, as well as the location of the session and whether it will occur online. \r\n7.	You can also write a note for the student to view before the session, but this field is optional. \r\n8.	Once you have filled in all the required information, click Submit.  \r\n9.	Once you have submitted the information you will be asked whether you want to confirm. Please review the information you provided to make sure it is correct. If it is accurate, click Confirm. If not, hit Cancel in order to make changes to the information.  \r\n10.	Your student will receive confirmation that their credit card has been charged as well as a summary of the session details. \r\n\r\nI hope you find these tips helpful, and thank you again for being a part of our community! \r\n\r\nHappy tutoring, \r\n\r\nTamara Allen\r\nDirector of Tutor & Student Development\r\nAvidBrain',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL),

I appreciate your concern, and I would like to help explain our phases of growth. First, we needed to have a fully functional website and test it to ensure quality. Then, we recruited tutors so that students in various locations and subject areas nationwide will be able to find the tutor they need. Finally, we have been actively recruiting new students to use AvidBrain through both word-of-mouth referrals and online advertising. We appreciate your patience as our community grows. \r\n\r\nThere are several ways students can find you. The job board is one of them, and it is updated frequently as new tutoring opportunities arise. The number of jobs on the job board should increase as time goes on, but in general, we cannot guarantee there will always be jobs in every area on any given day. \r\n\r\nAnother way students can find you is by going directly to your profile and messaging you. Many students have chosen to message tutors directly rather than posting a job on the job board, so be on the lookout for messages from potential students. \r\n\r\nThe third way you can gain more exposure on AvidBrain is by creating a short (1-2 minute) video and sending it to Jake at jake.stoll@avidbrain.com.

We value you, the tutor, as the most important part of our community, so please continue to let us know of any feedback, comments, or questions you have. \r\n\r\nAll the best, \r\nTamara',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',334),

It does take time from you and work on your part to fill out the applications, write essays, poems, art work....or what is needed to apply to a scholarship. What I can help you with is: find a variety of scholarships so you won&#39;t be bored with just writing essays, give you all the information needed to apply to a scholarship, give you deadlines for submissions and review your essays before you submit to give you additional ideas to make it &#34;great&#34;. Some scholarships take minutes to apply to online, some may take a couple of hours to write an essay and submit it online, and some scholarships want you to mail your application. I have a list of questions that you can answer that will help me search for scholarships. Take a look at it and answer as much as possible with as much detail as possible and let me know if it&#39;s something you want me to help you with. my fee is $125 per hour and I can work  as many hours as you need--I can work 1 hour, 2 hours, etc. \r\n\r\nScholarship search questionnaire:\r\n1.

My favorite part was when I wrote something about you are going to wonder about me and you wrote that ship already sailed a long time ago :)  Thought that was hilarious!  I think that was using your collective avid brains (sorry, I know, pretty bad)  to come up on the search engines.  I was involved in a business and initially paid to have that done, then found out it is really just a line of code you need to add to your web site for each of the search engines.  I am sure you know the online tutoring web site field is pretty well stocked.  I am a member of several but the most prolific seems to be wyzant.\r\n\r\n Actually, I found another loner just the other day after doing the laundry.   I have no clue where his compadres is hiding and the this one is not talking.

Honestly, I will email people I am trying to schedule interviews with and sometimes add humor if the situation calls for it, and sometimes it falls flat. Usually, after I am done talking with them, I realize why. Most tutors are great, but a few are far too serious for me.\r\n\r\nYes, Wyzant is the biggest and I had never even heard of them until I started working for AvidBrain. That doesn&#39;t say much for them. Keith was the number one tutor in the nation last year for Wyzant. He tutored for over 2,000 hours and they sent him a coffee mug for Christmas! Seriously?! A coffee mug?! They also scanned everyone&#39;s emails to make sure they weren&#39;t trying to tutor students through the back door. So they pay a bunch of people to be email Nazi&#39;s. Wow. We figured most our tutors won&#39;t want to do that since we will have resources and other things that will make you want to log hours with us. Also, you receive a higher percentage, so the incentive isn&#39;t a great. I&#39;m sure there are a few lone tutors who will buck the system, but it&#39;s not worth hiring a group of email Gestapo guards.\r\n\r\nAs far as the lone sock - I have often wondered what it would take to make the lone sock talk. I&#39;m not into torture and I&#39;m not sure it would work anyway. There obviously is honor among hosiery, even if your mate leaves you. You might be able to get to them by bringing up the mother ball of yarn that spawned them. Who knows?\r\n\r\nMake sure you email me after you get your first student. I&#39;d like to know.\r\n\r\nHave a great day! Stay in touch!\r\n\r\nAmy',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',484),

	(529,'dl357@georgetown.edu','keith@avidbrain.com',1,'2015-05-14 16:24:08','Reply: Reply: How are you?','Hi Darby - both, we need to recruit tutors and students. You can do online or face-to-face recruiting. One tutor for us in AZ got us over 3000+ tutors in the past 3 months. That&#39;s a potential of $15K! another staff member been getting us 130 applicants per night, so around $650 per part-time work.\r\n\r\nWe need our recruiters to be creative. Meaning, we believe we have the best system, we pay our tutors the most, we have high quality tutors, all are interviewed and background check and we want to provide the most services to both our students and tutors.\r\n\r\nThus, it should be easy to recruit students and tutors. All tutors are other firms should join us, there&#39;s no membership fees, we automatically give them 5% raise, we go up to 90% take-home pay, we also pay tutors who bring over their own students 95%! there&#39;s so much upside for tutors to be on our system. \r\n\r\nFinding tutors is easy, they are listed on many other sites, on craigslist, job boards, both college and high school job boards.\r\n\r\nAlso, think outside the box, posting our ad on church flyers, bulletin boards and their website.\r\n\r\nYou would have your own unique promo code so every time a student or tutor signs up, you get $5, it is that easy.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want to chat more. Would love to explain more. We truly want to disrupt this whole industry so need all our tutors help in getting the word out.\r\n\r\nWe are nationwide but will add both the UK and Canada by June.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your support.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nKeith Rezendes\r\nCEO / Co-founder\r\nAvidbrain.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',528),

He doubled his rate again and double the number of students again!

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

We are still working long hours trying to figure out the best ways to recruit, other than improve our SEO, which we are still working on. Hang in there with us and I think within 6-12 months, you could be tutoring full time. Take care of yourself Sam and I&#39;ll let you know when your shirt goes out.

I didn&#39;t get a package yet, but my point is, I wanted to make sure I hadn&#39;t left a package of yours stranded out in space, and I didn&#39;t want to miss it entirely. I assumed you meant the new shirt you&#39;d ordered by &#34;other.&#34; \r\n\r\nI hope you had a great holiday last weekend/Monday!

I still have some questions, but let me keep tinkering with this until I hit a wall that I just can&#39;t climb without some help--when I do I&#39;ll hit you up again and we can set a time to meet.  In general what&#39;s the best day/time for you?  \r\n\r\nI&#39;m not a student, I got a graduate degree in Philosophy but became interested in Math and Science in the process.  I&#39;m mostly self-learning programming for a variety of reasons related to studying other things.  For instance I want to eventually study Algorithms; I&#39;d like to know how to make and do things with computers generally; I want to be able to use a CAS like maybe Sage; I&#39;d like to learn a little &#34;philosophy of computing&#34; like the idea of computability, P=NP, AI, information theory; I&#39;d like to have at least the basic skills necessary should I want to do any data analytics or statistical computing; and so on.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, my work is going to be pretty open-ended.  I&#39;m just setting my own goals, and broadly my main goal right now is just to have a beginner&#39;s understanding of Java.  For instance, if I knew as much as was necessary to get a 5 on the AP CompSci test I&#39;d feel like I knew as much as I want to know.\r\n\r\nAnyway, for when it might become useful, here is my contact info:\r\n\r\nSkype username - rdanneskjold11\r\nPhone - 347-589-2747\r\n\r\nHow does payment work?

Here is the text of the original email I received from my friend:\r\n\r\nEssentially, I&#39;m seeking Special Ed. advice and I thought I&#39;d consult an expert.\r\n \r\nI have an old friend who lives in queen creek with his wife and two children.  They have an eight year old son who has ADHD and borderline autism. the mother home schooled him last year but would prefer a school for his socialization. He is at least of average intelligence.  They have not been able to  find a good public school.  The private schools are not eager to take him because such kids require extra time.\r\n\r\nI suspect that Queen Creek is too far for you to teach or tutor. \r\n\r\nMy Dad told me that the teachers at Phoenix Hebrew Academy were very good with kids like this.  The parents are not jewish.  They probably can afford private tuition.  They are resigned to the cost.\r\n\r\nSo the questions are:\r\n1.  Do you have any interest in tutoring?\r\n2.  If not, do you know of any capable tutors on the east side who would be interested in such a student.\r\n3.  Are there any Jewish schools on the east side of the valley that would (1)  take a non-jewish student given the issues listed above; and (2)  Are the east valley jewish elementary schools any good or equipped to deal with such issues?   \r\n\r\nAnd here is my reply to him so far:\r\n\r\nI doubt that Phoenix Hebrew Academy would actually work for  him, especially since there is no religio-cultural reason for him to be in a Jewish school.  And I must agree that Queen Creek is further than I want to commute.  May I shoot this question to some associates who might possibly know someone out that way? \r\n\r\n\r\nI just got to thinking a little bit.  On the &#34;what do we do as homeschoolers for socialization&#34; question:\r\nHave they looked at:\r\nhttp://homeschool.meetup.com/cities/us/az/queen_creek/\r\nhttp://www.home-school.com/groups/AZ.html\r\nhttp://www.afhe.org/support_groups_maricopa_county.html\r\n?\r\n\r\nAnd... on the teaching side, how did last year go?  Are they able to handle the curriculum?  Are there areas where they feel ill-equipped to teach him?\r\n\r\nI haven&#39;t gotten answers on that yet,\r\n\r\nMaurice',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',903),

Thank you so much for the tee shirt (which fits perfectly by the way) and the book markers. This is a brilliant idea! I actually was thinking about going on indeed.com and finding parents who have put up their request for tutors, for their children and seeing if there is a way for me to contact them individually. I realized that the request for tutors was lower and I am guessing it is because it is the end of the school year, but I am sure there are students who will need help for summer school and such. I will let you know how it goes when I attempt this idea. Thank you again for keeping in touch! \r\nHave a wonderful weekend! \r\n',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',763),

So this morning we did the book markers on the cars in all the SAT lots. So easy because you don&#39;t have to bother anybody. Here we are in the desert and it was actually sprinkling! This NEVER happens in June! Next weekend is ACT and SSAT, so check and see what schools are holding the test sites in your area.\r\n\r\nThat is a good idea about indeed.com. It&#39;s where we find tutors, but hadn&#39;t thought about students. We have actually found some students on Craig&#39;s List believe it or not! We should come out with a newsletter this week with marketing ideas for our tutors. Not everyone wants to do this and that&#39;s fine, but the more people we having doing this, the better.

Once you have entered your payment information into your account and we have agreed on a time for the tutoring session, I can create a tutoring session for us on here. To do this, I fill out a form saying how much I am charging as well as the length of the session.

Once I have completed this, you will be notified about the information that I had entered. \r\n\r\nThen on the agreed upon day and time, we will have our Skype tutoring session. After it has been completed, I will log into avidbrain and confirm that the tutoring session has been completed. Then you will be charged the amount. \r\n\r\nAll of the scheduling and payment will be processed through avidbrain.

I hope this reaches you before you get to lunch. Your son is certainly within my realm of experience and expertise. I would be comfortable tutoring him. To answer your questions:\r\n-I live in the New Berlin area, which is to say, the greater Milwaukee area. I am about 15 minutes southwest of downtown Milwaukee, if that gives you an idea.\r\n-My listed rate is $60 per hour, although since the everything on AvidBrain is early and fresh, I&#39;m willing to do $50/hour. For 4 weeks and 3 times per week, that would come to $600 for the 1 month.\r\n-Regarding my experience, here is my description from my profile page:\r\nI took on tutoring in 2012 as a part-time interest, and since then, tutoring has grown into both a bread-winning tool and a personal love. My tutoring experience is broad: I&#39;ve tutored in-person and online; I&#39;ve conducted an online class for video game development; and I&#39;ve been invited to travel out-of-state to be a live-in, personal tutor for a family. I tutor in most subjects, and I specialize in test-taking (ACT and SAT, CLEP, and so on). To attain my undergraduate degree, I used tests exclusively, such as CLEPs and DANTES, to achieve the degree. Thus, tests became second-nature to me, both their content and the nature of test-taking skills in general. I am also experienced in photography, drawing, and digital/graphic art and software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator; I enjoy tutoring in these subjects as well. Warmth, patience, and precision are my personal themes, and I want my students to feel as comfortable as possible so their minds can relax and focus peacefully.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have more questions, Tim. I look forward to hearing from you!\r\n-Sam',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',950),

I&#39;d love to see how I can help your son Phil with English! Below is the information that you requested about how I tutor:\r\n\r\nArea of Residence: Danville, CA by the Blackhawk neighborhood. However, I do think it is worth mentioning that the first time I tutor a student in-person, I prefer to do so at a local public place, like a Starbucks or library. I hope that won&#39;t be a problem. \r\n\r\nTotal Cost of Tutoring: If you decide to have me tutor Phil for one month three times a week for an hour, the cost would come out to $480, as I charge $40 per hour (even though this is on the cheaper end of the national average for tutoring). \r\n\r\nYears of Teaching Experience: I have been teaching, tutoring, and mentoring since as early as my freshman year of high school and thus have accumulated five years worth of experience in those fields. In fact, I have been a speech and debate instructor and mentor for the last three years and have had to walk students through the process of writing prepared speeches and delivering them effectively. In addition, I specialize in ACT Writing, SAT Reading, and SAT Writing, so I am sure I will have no problem helping your son with English.\r\n\r\nHopefully, I was able to address all of your questions and concerns. Please let me know if you would like to proceed, and we can schedule a quick, free, in-person consultation so that I can meet you and your son at a local Starbucks or library and ask you and your son more detailed questions about how specifically you would like me to help and how I tutor English.

All of it sounds good. Before sending over my address, schedule, and check information, I wanted to clarify about the timetable: I gather you are referring to the lessons starting next year, in 2016? You had mentioned the lessons starting in February of next year, so I wanted to confirm your meaning and what you had in mind as the start date.\r\n-Sam',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',962),

I have a couple of questions before we proceed forth with issuing payment and scheduling the tutoring sessions. What particular subjects is your son Phil in need of assistance with? Is your son hearing impaired as well? You mentioned that lessons will commence by February 8th, did you mean June 8th? I am not sure why you would need my physical address since I suggested to either meet at your location or for me preferrably do the lessons through Skype. Does your son have access to Skype and does he know how  to use it? Also what age is your son? What grade level is he in? Look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nPaul',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',963),

I just wanted to reach out to you with one suggestion. I would recommend uploading a higher definition photo, as tutors with clear photos tend to get more business. \r\n\r\nEverything else looks great! \r\n\r\nHave a great week,\r\nTamara \r\nThe Avidbrain Team',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL),
	(1030,'dgateward@gmail.com','tamara@avidbrain.com',3,'2015-06-08 19:21:43','Perfecting your Avidbrain Profile','Hi Deja, \r\n\r\nJust wanted to reach out to you to help with completing your profile. Here are some tips:\r\n\r\nFollow these guidelines to attract more students: \r\n\r\nUpload a friendly, high-resolution profile photo \r\n•	Tutors with a photo get 300% more business! \r\n•	Aim for a look that&#39;s professional, yet friendly and approachable.\r\n•	No group photos please, and don’t forget to smile!\r\nCustomize your Subject Descriptions\r\nThe Subject Descriptions are another opportunity to let your personality and expertise shine. Click on &#34;Subjects I Tutor&#34; to view or update your subject descriptions.\r\n \r\n     What to include in your Subject Descriptions:\r\n•	How you became an expert in this subject\r\n•	Your teaching approach & strategies\r\n•	Some of your insider knowledge about the subject\r\n•	Positive results your students have achieved through working with you\r\nEdit your Short Description & write a Personal Statement (200-500 words)\r\n\r\nAn attention-grabbing Short Description and a well-written Personal Statement both help you make a good first impression.\r\n\r\n7 out of 10 clients say they won&#39;t choose a tutor with grammar or punctuation errors in their profile, so don&#39;t forget to edit and spell-check your responses! \r\n\r\nTutors with at least 200 words in their Personal Statements attract more parents and students!\r\n  \r\n    Be sure to include the following in your Personal Statement: \r\n•	Your prior tutoring experience (if any)\r\n•	Your skills and qualifications\r\n•	Your teaching style & philosophy\r\n•	Examples of positive results your students have achieved\r\nExample Short Description/Personal Statement:\r\nTest Prep Specialist—SAT, ACT, GRE, & GMAT\r\nI am a highly qualified tutor with over five years of experience helping students achieve their goals. I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n-------------------\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful! Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help you. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nTamara\r\nThe AvidBrain Team\r\n\r\n',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL),

Is your son going to be in Kansas this summer?  I notice that you are in Carrollton, TX.  Although I could tutor at a distance, I don&#39;t think it is the best way.  I prefer face-to-face.  However, I would consider an online arrangement if you have Skype and if your son is able to navigate the technology successfully.  However, I have another issue:  I will not be available from June 15 through July 10 because of other obligations.  I would consider tutoring your son online after July 12th (a Sunday) if you are still interested.  You can look at my tutor profile to see all of the areas in which I can tutor.  It would be helpful, however, to give me more information about your son&#39;s needs.  In what subjects does he need the most help?\r\nThank you for your interest,\r\nDr. Joelyn K. Foy (Jo Foy)\r\n',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL),

I currently reside in Glendale, AZ.  Depending on travel accommodations, the fee would range from $150-$200 per week.  Does your son have prior math experience, or what is the nature behind the request of him needing a tutor?  I would be glad to complete this offer if you can provide me more details on the needs of this situation.  I want to make sure I set up a detailed plan on how I can help your son develop strong Algebra skills.  I am available to tutor in person or online as well.  Talk to you soon!\r\n\r\nStay Blessed,\r\nAmyLee',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',1094),

Many of my students have told me that I was the first person who showed them that Algebra makes sense.  I am particularly good at identifying specific skills that are challenging for my students and helping them master those skills so that they can make fast and solid progress.\r\nI live in north Phoenix, near the 51 freeway.\r\nMy standard rate is $50/hour, so that would be $150/week, or about $600/month.\r\nI taught in private schools on the east coast for 20 years and have taught in public schools here in Arizona for the last 3 years.  I have also tutored numerous students throughout that time.\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.  Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask me any questions you may have.  My phone number is 480-559-3138 (If this doesn&#39;t show in your email, AvidBrain may strip it out until certain conditions are met.  I know another site that does that, but don&#39;t know how AvidBrain handles that yet.)\r\nMaurice',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',1099),

For clients outside my commuting radius, I can tutor via computer using whatever platform works for both parties (Google Hangout, Skype, etc.)\r\n\r\nI have been a committed educator, tutor, and child advocate for the past 20 years, if not all of my life.

Which area(s) does Phil need some help in?\r\nHere is some more information regarding my background:\r\n\r\nSkills:\r\nThe most important skills that I want to apply to helping anyone are: identifying the challenges and formulating a plan that will serve the learner&#39;s need in order to help him/her meet the desired goals. I am bilingual (English & Polish) and can speak conversational French. I also have dealt with families and students of varying backgrounds and demographics (especially while teaching in New York City Schools). Also have experience coaching sports (Ice Hockey) and Marching Band drum lines, thus helping young athletes and musicians realize their untapped potential!\r\n\r\nResidence:\r\nI currently reside in the Los Angeles, CA area (Canoga Park). Skype or Google Hangouts sessions online are also offered.\r\n\r\nTeaching Experience:\r\nOver 20 years of teaching experience. I began teaching percussion early on and then transitioned into teaching additional subjects at the middle childhood level in public as well as private schools. Music, math, and special education have been the areas that I have taught to many students. Attended Pace University and earned a Masters of Science in Teaching (Middle Childhood General & Special Education) while teaching students with Autism. This is crucial because each student regardless of current placements and or skills has varied learning modalities, (different ways he or she will learn). Authored an online jazz drumming course, published in 2015, (for the Music Learning Collective University in the UK).\r\n\r\nAmount needed to invest for tutoring services for 1 month (1 hour per day 3 times/week):\r\n$900.00 USD @ $75 per hour\r\n\r\nFeel free to let me know if you have any additional inquiries.\r\n\r\nHave a great day!\r\nMark',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',1082),

I have over 10 years experience tutoring Math, Reading, English and Science as an employee of Middlesex County College and independently.  I meet with students Monday through Saturday so let me know what times might work for you and your son.   Why don&#39;t we schedule a session, so that you can see if I am a good fit for tutoring your son?  My rate is $45 per hour, and I have many hours of tutoring under my belt.  Please feel free to review my profile and ask any questions you might have.\r\n\r\nKind Regards, Lisa   \r\n\r\nMore about my tutoring experience   I love learning and your son can too. I believe that every student has the ability to learn. As a tutor, my job is to patiently work with you as you tackle challenging concepts. I break these into smaller learning objectives. I highlight your strengths to build confidence so you can work on and improve the areas that you struggle with. I use encouragement and humor to prevent you from burning out during our sessions.   While attending college, I discovered my love of learning and helping others to learn. I worked for Middlesex County College as a peer English and Math tutor. I also assisted students with how to use Word and Excel in the English Department Computer Lab. I graduated with Magna Cum Laude honors from Kean University thanks to my determination and study skills. I informally worked with my classmates when they had difficulty with English, Reading, Math, Science and various Business courses. After college I worked with a few Elementary, High School and College students. My greatest teaching accomplishment is helping an adult who could not read or write to do so.   \r\n\r\nA review from one of my previous students   &#34;Lisa tutored me through many years of my education in math and several other subject. She worked with me one-on-one through the later part of my middle school and though out my entire high school career to help me to understand and apply the technical skills that would carry me through college and for the rest of my life. She was able to not only teach me the things that I couldn&#39;t understand, but she made learning fun which gave me the desire to learn more! It is because of her teaching and teaching methods that I have reached such great success in college and in my career! She taught me that even if something is hard to grasp or even seemingly impossible at the moment, I can do it! I just have to find the right avenue to lead me to finish line. To this day (many years later) I still contact her if there is something that I just can&#39;t comprehend, and she takes the time to teach me.&#34;   - Candice from New Jersey\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',1072),

By your question, I am guessing you mean when will you get your first student. Remember, we are a new company and just started marketing for students April 15. We had to get tutors first. Also, it&#39;s summer, so demand is typically a little slower. We are marketing like crazy for students as we speak and it will probably take a little while for our efforts to take hold.

Be patient because I think it will be worth it in the long run!\r\n\r\nSome of our tutors are putting postings on Craig&#39;s List with a link to their AvidBrain  profile page.

Obviously that certifies myself in ability to teach beginning mathematics and arithmetic as well. I am also quite knowledgeable in the fields of geometry and trigonometry. If any of these fall under what your son needs tutored in, then I am more than capable of assisting him. I live around the Pittsburgh area, in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. It would cost about $240 for what you are asking for under my services. I have some experience tutoring some people older than your son; however, there shouldn&#39;t be a problem with tutoring him. I am usually quite thorough and patient with my students. \r\n\r\nI hope this is what you were looking for, if you need more information just message myself again. I can do lessons in person and through Skype if necessary. \r\n\r\nDakota Leonard \r\n\r\nP.S.

You have good instincts. I apologize for this happening. We did a mass email to all our tutors letting them know, but for some reason a few people didn&#39;t receive the email.

Now potential students get one courtesy email before they have to enter a credit card to message any other tutors. I just am flabbergasted the lengths people will go to to scam other people!

Does your caretaker lives in Hoover or Birmingham? This will allow me to figure out a meeting place. Also, on another note, payments are arranged through Avidbrain.

The neighborhood kids are out for the Summer and they often come over to play with my daughter, Emma, so most days it is like a zoo here.  \r\n\r\nI do like your idea about running a personal Craigslist advert to get students.   I am wondering if someone at AvidBrain  could post one of your ads on each website like Care.com or any website for Moms, Dads, and Families as this may work in gathering students to AvidBrain.  Another possibility that I am thinking could be to contact some of the online public schools, there are many in different states and the kids might benefit from extra tutoring.  To get some connections with online public elementary and high schools may be a good way to make contacts with schools and parents.  I am enrolling Emma in an online elementary school in Pennsylvania this Fall for the first time.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that you have reached out to me very much Amy.

In fact, I&#39;ve yet to receive a single request from a student.  I too just became a tutor on the AvidBrain network this past May.  Accordingly, I&#39;m not sure why my profile was featured on the main page - or maybe that&#39;s why it was (i.e., to advertise more directly to potential students).  I signed on to the program hoping it would involve hours closer to a part-time job, but I think you are right that competition in rather rough on the AvidBrain network amongst tutors.  I can&#39;t say for certain what would be helpful, since the whole point of the network is for students to select tutors, as I understand it.  I suppose geographical location might have something to do with it - since I live in a very rural area, as opposed to  large city where tutoring services might be in more demand.  Is that the case for you?  As for the money spent, take it from a Globalization Studies major, that it never hurts to be more connected in the world, especially when those connections involve a network that is larger than anything else one participates in.  Hope that helps.  \r\n\r\nI  appreciate you contacting me.  Thanks, and good luck hunting for potential students!  \r\n\r\nDrew Hoffman',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',1462),

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

	(1832,'amy@avidbrain.com','tjakovlic@gmail.com',532,'2015-06-20 05:22:28','Recruiting ideas','Amy:  I see that many of the students to date are what commonly thought of as &#34;adult&#34; or &#34;college&#34; students and their subjects. Based on what I&#39;ve read to date on Avidbrain&#39;s marketing efforts that would be a result of going to college campuses and college fairs.  For the K-12 educators and students it might be necessary to contact YMCA&#39;s. Primarily because this organization often have a presence within school districts and their schools for after school care, athletics, and activities for children.  I believe teaming up with YMCA would be a good affiliation to have, and help Avidbrain&#39;s marketing campaign.\r\n\r\n  Also, school districts and parents are always looking for tutors to help their students. Reaching out to school boards, superintendents, and principals is another way  to make yourself known. Maybe try to market to very large metropolitan area school districts with populations over 500,000 residents. I see that Avidbrain is putting out ads in major newspapers and online in large metropolitan areas, but the marketing group may actually have to contact and meet these big city school administrations as well. There is nothing like being physically present at the city school administration building and school board meeting to make that positive impression that Avidbrain and its educators can assist students in literacy, numeracy, and special populations like ESL and ELL. Even if some large city school boards have services for their students in place, just by listening to what are their biggest areas of academic concern might generate ideas within Avidbrain&#39;s education consultants and marketing team on how best to  strategically advertise and collectively bring Avidbrain&#39;s human resources front and center to the parents and their students who need it most.  I&#39;m thinking that Phoenix would be the first place, and then stretch that campaign to other big cities in Southwest: El Paso, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, San Diego, and of course Los Angeles. Again, just trying to provide some typical avenues that might be a rich resource for Avidbrain&#39;s students and tutors to connect. \r\n\r\nTom Jakovlic\r\nReading Specialist, LA & SS Educator',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',787),

I like the YMCA idea. As far as I know, I don&#39;t think we have spent any money on newspaper ads. We have spend money on google ads and will do FB ads. The FB ads will be aimed at the Moms. We are reaching out to the schools here in AZ first to see what works and what doesn&#39;t and what avenues work best, then we will take it all over the county. Targeting schools is what we are currently working on and getting tutoring jobs through Title 1 money. Right now, none of the principals are in because it&#39;s summer. Another month and they should be back. I think the biggest reason for the increased age level for the current students is simply because school is out. We are getting some SAT and other test prep students since it&#39;s that time of year and many just got done taking it and realize they need more help.\r\n\r\nI appreciate all your suggestions and will pass them along.

Many students reach out personally to the tutors that they are interested in and will send them a message, so be sure to check your messages regularly. Also, you may always check the job board and message the students that you feel you could tutor and ask if they would like to set up some sessions with you. \r\n\r\nJust today we got a new post to the job board for a 10th grader who needs help with Study Skills. She lives in Arizona, but you may message her and ask if she is interested in having online sessions. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps!

I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

There are a couple of different ways to be proactive in getting students. The first way is to regularly check the job board. You can find this in the upper-right hand corner titled &#34;Jobs&#34;. We have found that many of our students are also searching for and messaging tutors directly rather than posting to the job board. Be sure to regularly check your messages as well, as you might get a request directly from a student. We have another feature that we will implement in the future that will send you an email with a list of potential students that we feel would be a good match for you that you can message.\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the process of acquiring Scribblar for the use of our tutor and students. You may find out more about the program at: https://scribblar.com.\r\n\r\nUntil we have acquired the program. we recommend our tutors to use other free online programs such as Skype and Google Hangouts.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nAshlynn Kindschy',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',2084),

I like readings, sailing, skiing, and watching classic movies on Netflix.  My strengths are design, trouble shooting technology, being a good team player and I am very reliable. My weakness are communicating and grammar. When I want to say something to a co-worker I really have to slow down and chose my words carefully. I forget to do that from time to time and I go with words that don&#39;t present me that well professionally.  Grammar has always been a struggle for me. I pushed it off to the side because I never had to write a lot for a job until now. When I was in college my English Professor would not grade any of my papers because my writing was terrible. I forget words or use a comma wrong. Someone would teach me or show me why my sentences where bad but I never understood it or learned to apply other papers I would be writing. If I had my mom correct my papers she would criticize me in a way that  I would get very upset and it  would make me feel kind of dumb, I am college educated woman and I have not idea how to write. I figure now is a good time to learn how to write better. Public speaking I have never excelled at ever. When I would have to speak in front of a crowd 30 or more I stumble on my words, my brain goes blank, and every single person can tell I am super nervous.  That is where I am at now.

For public speaking, Skype would be best because we can discuss your progress in real time.\r\n\r\nYou pay for your tutoring hours via this Web site (so you will need some kind of payment information on file).

I have a copy of a typed and signed teacher recommendation that I received recently from a teacher who I worked with during my 10+ volunteer years at Gates Elementary School in Acton, MA.  \r\n\r\n* Is that something that the AvidBrain staff would like to have?  If so, it can be viewed on my LinkedIn profile or I can send it to you in .jpeg format (I scanned it in).\r\n\r\n* Is there some place on the AvidBrain site where I could display the teacher recommendation for potential clients to see?  It&#39;s an excellent one, and I&#39;m very proud of it.\r\n\r\n* How can I view my profile the way that students would see it?  I&#39;m curious to see if my college education is displayed.

We recently connected on LinkedIn and I just registered as a tutor on AvidBrain the other day.  I really enjoy many of the quotes you post on LinkedIn, and I see that we both have similar math and science, and teaching backgrounds.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m glad to be a part of the AvidBrain tutor community!\r\n\r\nI have some feedback on using the site and a question or 2.\r\n\r\n* When replying to job requests using the lightbox (from url https://www.avidbrain.com/jobs#messageBox13958 for example), the Message textbox drag handle only works horizontally.  It would be better if it worked vertically and extended the height of the surrounding lightbox, or triggered a vertical scroll bar on the lightbox when the textbox is extended vertically (the way that LinkedIn messages work).\r\n\r\n* The jobs page doesn&#39;t show any indication that a tutor has already responded to a job request or not.  You need to go to the Mailbox page and look at the Sent folder in order to determine that.  It would be a much nicer UX in my opinion if there was an indication of this on the jobs page at https://www.avidbrain.com/jobs# ... for example, it could say &#34;Follow Up&#34; instead of &#34;Message&#34; on the green buttons.\r\n\r\n* If you are on page 2 or beyond on the jobs list, and you click Message or View to get to the job details page, i.e. https://www.avidbrain.com/students/texas/houston/31343937, then it is too difficult to get back to jobs list page.  The browser back button always takes you back to the first page in the jobs list (and not the page that you were on, when you clicked Message or View).\r\n\r\n* Question: are there any online features available in the web app to facilitate online tutoring and whiteboard sessions?  If not, are there any plans to add such features?\r\n\r\n* Question: are there any automated filtering features that only display the jobs that match subjects covered by a tutor?  Currently, I seem to see all available jobs, not just those that I can tutor.\r\n\r\n* Question: I am well-known, among my coworkers at least :-), for my bug testing and feature verification skills (see my LinkedIn profile).  Are there any part-time or consulting QA opportunities within AvidBrain available?  The same question applies to web development opportunities.   I am a 33+ year software engineer who is switching careers into technical tutoring, but I&#39;d love to be able to split my time 25% with keeping my coding skills up-to-date and %75 tutoring.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your time, and keep posting those great quotes on LinkedIn!\r\n\r\nBobby Rigano\r\nAspiring Math, Statistics and Programming Tutor\r\nYork, ME',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL),

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

I live in Maine, so obviously, any tutoring sessions would need to be online. I can help you set up a free Skype account just for the tutoring sessions, if you&#39;d like. You can delete the account when our tutoring sessions are completed. \r\n\r\nMy bachelor&#39;s degree is in Applied Math and my master&#39;s degree is in Statistics. I&#39;m new to AvidBrain, but I&#39;ve done a lot of tutoring over the years. I helped both of my daughters throughout their school years (K - 12 and college) with their math homework. My older daughter is now a high school math teacher and my younger daughter is a biology major currently in grad school. I was a teaching assistant in graduate school, and tutored students in a variety of math and statistics courses. I&#39;ve also used my math and statistics skills frequently over the course of my 33+ year career in the high-tech industry. At my most recent high-tech job, I used my statistics skills regularly to analyze data and generate charts and reports. And I am currently tutoring junior high, high school and college students in math subjects. Please see my profile for more details. \r\n\r\nNote that you&#39;ll need to provide payment info to AvidBrain. Their policy is that I can&#39;t exchange contact information or tutor someone until that&#39;s happened. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ll follow up with a phone call.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions for me, please reply to this message and ask.

I am a Stanford alumni (class of 1983) and I live in Maine, so obviously, any tutoring sessions would need to be online. I can help you set up a free Skype account just for the tutoring sessions, if you&#39;d like. You can delete the account when our tutoring sessions are completed. \r\n\r\nMy bachelor&#39;s degree is in Applied Math and Statistics from SUNY at Stony Brook and my master&#39;s degree is in Statistics from Stanford. I&#39;m new to AvidBrain, but I&#39;ve done a lot of tutoring over the years. I helped both of my daughters throughout their school years (K - 12 and college) with their math homework. My older daughter is now a high school math teacher and my younger daughter is a biology major currently in grad school. I was a teaching assistant in graduate school, and tutored students in a variety of math and statistics courses. I&#39;ve also used my math and statistics skills frequently over the course of my 33+ year career in the high-tech industry. At my most recent high-tech job, I used my statistics skills regularly to analyze data and generate charts and reports. And I am currently tutoring junior high, high school and college students in math subjects. Please see my profile for more details. \r\n\r\nNote that you&#39;ll need to provide payment info to AvidBrain. Their policy is that I can&#39;t exchange contact information or tutor someone until that&#39;s happened. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions for me, please reply to this message and ask. I look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\n\r\nBobby Rigano \r\nMaine-based math and statistics Tutor',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL);

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

While I have not officially conducted any professional development workshops for teachers regarding teaching writing to children, I do have the background and experience in knowing the steps to take and the strategies to use to help students with their writing.\r\n\r\nBack in 2009, I participated in a federally-funded national program called the National Writing Project. I am attaching the website url to the end of this email. This was a full-day, month long workshop for teachers of all grade levels. It was specifically designed to serve dual purposes: 1) help teachers develop their own writing skills and 2) help teachers help students develop their writing skills.\r\n\r\nI have used all that I learned from this graduate level workshop, and I&#39;ve seen some great results for the middle school students I taught. Plus, writing is my passion and talking about writing is just as fun.\r\n\r\nI am confident that, with enough preparation time and guidance from you, I could easily present an effective and engaging workshop for teachers who wish to improve their students&#39; writing skills. A lot of what I learned not only proved fruitful, but changed the way the students think about and towards writing. \r\n\r\nIf you are still interested in speaking with me more about your needs, feel free to call me at 614-316-6382, or email. We can even Skype if you have that at your end.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for contacting me and I look forward to hearing from you in one capacity or another.

That list of available students is growing slowly but surely, so your recruiting group is starting to make students aware of Avidbrain&#39;s tutoring services. I see that Avidbrain has a web blog site, so I will check it out. I do have a video that I posted, but the lighting wasn&#39;t very good. I&#39;ll have to resubmit my intro video. By the way, I love those t-shirts! Avidbrain logo and words are fine on the black shirts, but can I can&#39;t quite make out the white word &#34;Avid&#34; too well next to the green &#34;brain&#34; on the white/gray? shirts. Take a look. What do you think?\r\n\r\n I&#39;ve contacted a 2-3 students. No response to date, but it is early. I believe this whole site will take off come late September when students from K-22 will start seeking tutors in all manner of subjects content areas. Have to believe starting in late August that your recruiting team will be out at the various public school district administrative buildings, and talking to superintendents and principals in Scottsdale and other cities, and reaching out to colleges and university student services departments. If the colleges allow it, going to the university bookstores and student centers is likely a great way to meet and greet incoming freshman and other students who might seek out these tutoring services. Wishing you and the Avidbrain team well on that process. \r\n\r\nTom Jakovlic',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL),

I live in Maine, so obviously, any tutoring sessions would need to be online. We could use Skype or Mikogo, or some other free, remote meeting tool ... whatever you and your son are more comfortable with.   I&#39;ll talk more about this below.\r\n\r\nMy bachelor&#39;s degree is in Applied Math (SUNY at Stony Brook) and my master&#39;s degree is in Statistics (Stanford University). I&#39;m new to AvidBrain, but I&#39;ve done a lot of tutoring over the years. I helped both of my daughters throughout their school years (K - 12 and college) with their math homework. My older daughter is now a high school math teacher and my younger daughter is a biology major currently in grad school. I was a teaching assistant in graduate school, and tutored students in a variety of math and statistics courses. I&#39;ve also used my programming skills - in a wide range of programming languages - on a daily basis over the course of my 33+ year career in the high-tech industry.  I&#39;ve used C# and Javascript daily over the past 5 years in particular.   Please view my AvidBrain profile.  And I know more languages than the ones I&#39;ve listed there (such as Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Lisp, PL/1, etc.)  I can provide more information about my college education, my career history and my tutoring experience if you&#39;d like.\r\n\r\nI can help you set up Skype if you don&#39;t already have a Skype account. You can download the application and create an account for free, and you can establish a Skype user (such as JeffsSon.Programming.Tutoring) just for the purpose of our tutoring sessions. You can then delete that Skype account if you&#39;d like after we&#39;ve completed our tutoring sessions. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you. If you have any questions, please reply to this message and ask. \r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\n\r\nBobby Rigano \r\nMaine-based JavaScript Tutor \r\nphone: (207) 361-4588 \r\nskype: robert.rigano1\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL),

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!

So good to hear from you and I apologize for not getting back to you sooner!\r\n\r\nAbout the shirts, we have discontinued them for now. They were a great look and fabric, but the sizing was way off.  I&#39;d be happy to send you one if you weighed 300 lbs. or more, but that doesn&#39;t appear to be the case. We have a bunch of L and XL for men, but they are so huge! If you know anyone that might fit them, let me know. We have to get students before we can worry about tee shirts.\r\n\r\nYes, you are correct, we are planning to hit the schools and college campuses. We have already made inroads into the public school system since I happened to know a big wig there who can make introductions for us. We just have to wait until they are back into town. Everyone bolts here in AZ in July and you can imagine why! We are looking into Title 1 tutoring as well. We are planning on hiring ambassadors for ASU and U of A and see how that works. Get students to recruit for us and if it works, we will take that all over the country.\r\n\r\nOne thing that has been working is our Facebook ads. Foreign countries, such as Pakistan and India have really liked our ads and we are starting to see foreign students, which is so cool. We tried google ads and they didn&#39;t do anything. I really think once we get our name out there and parents hear we are the only website who does background checks and interviews, I think we will really take off. We also have an upcoming local t.v. show that we are going to be featured on and that should help. As soon as parents start using us, they will start talking and we will really gain traction. We are also doing a lot of blogging and I am waiting for you to do one!\r\n\r\nThanks for all your input and support, Thomas! Keep your ideas coming!\r\n\r\nTake care, Amy',NULL,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',2658),

I live in Maine, so obviously, our tutoring session would need to be online. We could use WyzAnt&#39;s online tools or Skype, whatever you&#39;re more comfortable with. (I can help you set up a free Skype account just for the tutoring session, if you&#39;d like. You can delete the account when our tutoring session is completed.) \r\n\r\nMy bachelor&#39;s degree is in Applied Math (SUNY at Stony Brook) and my master&#39;s degree is in Statistics (Stanford University). I&#39;m relatively new to WyzAnt, but I&#39;ve done a lot of tutoring over the years. I helped both of my daughters throughout their school years (K - 12 and college) with their math homework. My older daughter is now a high school math teacher and my younger daughter is a biology major currently in grad school. I was a teaching assistant in graduate school, and tutored students in a variety of math and statistics courses. I&#39;ve also used my math skills frequently over the course of my 33+ year career in the high-tech industry. At my most recent high-tech job, I used my statistics skills regularly to analyze data and generate charts and reports. And I am currently tutoring junior high, high school and college students in math subjects. \r\n\r\nI am very patient and soft-spoken, and I have a very strong statistics background. Please see my WyzAnt profile for more details.   I am familiar with the R Programming language, as I&#39;ve read articles about it, but I do not consider myself to be an expert on it.  I do however think that I could become an expert on it quickly because of my extensive statistics and computer programming background.  And I am highly motivated to do that, as R is something that I&#39;ve heard and read a lot about and have wanted to use.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions for me, please reply to my message and just ask.  We could also schedule a phone call so we could talk in advance of you making your decision on the best tutor. I look forward to hearing from you. \r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\n\r\nBobby Rigano \r\nMaine-based statistics Tutor \r\nphone: (207) 361-4588 \r\nskype: robert.rigano1\r\n',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',NULL),

I suspect by late August this site will be finding all manner of students in every conceivable subject content area and grade level for tutors. I believe you&#39;ll know by the number of students and tutors in say October who uses Avidbrain and thereby determine how effective were your recruiting efforts. \r\n\r\nTitle One, Special Education, ESL and ELL K-12 schools and their students will be a big driver of tutoring business. In my view, the online aspects of Avidbrain are as significant a source of tutoring opportunities as is the in the face to face tutoring.   I will definitely to look at the Avidbrain blogging, and will contribute to that effort as well. T-Shirts are great for campus efforts, but your right, the key right now is getting exposure in more visual formats, like t.v. broadcasts, YouTube uploads, Facebook, and Avidbrain blogging. In an era of social media and internet exposure, and with so many individuals having I-Pads, smartphones, and tablets, finding ways to harness that social media traffic, reinforcing and extending that Avidbrain tutoring services message on local t.v. access, and going directly to school districts, community colleges, and universities with the message of providing licensed and credentialed subject experts as tutors for students is the way to ramp up marketing. Making those contacts through networking and having t.v., social media, and print access will all help Avidbrain&#39;s business profile and visibility to parents and students. Really looking forward to this fall. \r\n\r\nHey, when that t.v. broadcast is on the air, let me know where I can see on YouTube. I definitely want to see how that advertisement or interview goes. Thanks for the update. \r\n\r\nTom Jakovlic',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'inbox',2806),

So far, your profile looks great and is complete. That is the first step in attracting students! Another great way to increase your chances is by checking the Job Board frequently in order to respond as quickly as possible to new student postings. This can be found under the &#34;Jobs&#34; tab in the upper right-hand corner.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed that many of our students are searching and contacting our tutors directly, so be sure to keep an eye out for messages from potential students! We are continuing to reach out through many different channels to bring in the students. We have been working hard on SEO, AdWords, Paid Advertisements and are partnering up with middle schools, high schools, and colleges. That way when the school year rolls around, we will be the go-to tutoring firm. We are making great strides with our Title 1 partnership. We are the only tutoring firm that requires all of our tutors to be background checked. Schools love that aspect and also the fact that students can search and find the tutors that fit their specific needs.\r\n\r\nYou are a vital part of our company and we appreciate your patience as we are working hard to grow and build a strong student base for our tutors. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps!

I specialize in test prep, including the PSAT, SAT, ACT, GRE, and GMAT. I also tutor junior high and high school students in Math (Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, and Geometry) and foreign languages, including Spanish levels 1 through 5 & AP Spanish, beginning French, and beginning German. \r\n\r\nI have a bachelor’s degree in Spanish and extensive experience working as a tutor. My career as a tutor started when I received training in test preparation with a private tutoring company where I worked for two years. Since then, I have continued to tutor independently and have guided many students through their test preparation process for both college entrance exams and AP exams. I provide not just tips and tricks to ace the SAT and other exams, but also share the comprehensive content knowledge necessary to excel on these exams.\r\nI customize and adapt my lessons to meet the unique needs of each individual student. I develop a rapport with each of my students, meeting them where they are and helping them to excel. My patience and enthusiasm for the subjects I teach create a positive environment in which real learning happens.\r\n\r\nI work mainly with junior high and high school students (PSAT, SAT, ACT, and academics), and adult learners (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, and ESL). My familiarity with multiple languages, such as Spanish, French, and German (in addition to my native English) helps me relate to the unique challenges of learning and studying in a foreign language. \r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI hope you find these suggestions helpful!
